# Python-Project
Implement Grep command in python.

# Steps to follow:-  
1.Will work on basic functinality of grep.  
2.Will try to include grep commands flags to implementation.  
3.Will include some testcases to code.  

# Problem Statement:-  Implement grep command using Python
Implement grep command in python supporting the following flags. The output should match that of grep command. Python regular expression should be used for the match unless -F is specified.

grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]

     -c, --count
             Only a count of selected lines is written to standard output.
     -F, --fixed-strings
             Interpret pattern as a set of fixed strings (i.e. force grep to behave as fgrep).
     -i, --ignore-case
             Perform case insensitive matching.  By default, grep is case sensitive.   
     -v, --invert-match
             Selected lines are those not matching any of the specified patterns.   
     -R, -r, --recursive
             Recursively search subdirectories listed.
